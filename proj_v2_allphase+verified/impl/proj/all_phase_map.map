    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     25
      Number with same-slice register load:     24
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   359 out of   6,822    5%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       284 out of  13,644    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,216
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           317 out of   1,216   26%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 241 out of   1,216   19%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         658 out of   1,216   54%
    Number of unique control sets:              37
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              69 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
