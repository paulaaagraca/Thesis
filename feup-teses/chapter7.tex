\section{Summary}

\section{Contributions }

The main contributions of this dissertation are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item A HDL system design with strict area constraints that receives signals from four different sensors and calculates its 
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

The developed work arose various innovative ideas and topics according to the state of the art on localization optimization methods. Therefore, there is the intent to produce a a scientific article on the subject to be submitted in the OCEANS Conference 2021.

The adopted optimization techniques in the present work are the starting point of a topic which is not very explored in the current literature. Consequently, there are several areas that can be improved as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementing the developed algorithm for AoA estimation as a real-time system which can be used for decision making during underwater navigation
	\item Using Machine Learning techniques in order to find the optimal hydrophone array configuration, to be positioned in an underwater vehicle
\end{itemize}
